                <p><span class="firstword">Elonias</span> was said to be the most powerful mortal in the history of Arv. His powers rivaled the gods' themselves.
                    He united the kingdoms of Kramesh and led the fight against the Arch Dragons, released by Ond to destroy Earth. He was an expert in both magic 
                    and physical fighting.</p><p> 
                    It wasn't only his power, that was remarkable,though. His natural ability to bring people together almost seemed like a miracle. His charisma and wits 
                    were the reason he became King of Kramesh, shortly after the War Against the Dragons. He was kind-hearted, brave and loving. </p><p> 
                    While his life, before the war is a mystery, many tales have been written about it. Some tell he was born into a regular, low-class family, while 
                    others say he was made by the gods themselves, to rise up and defeat the Arch Dragons. Many other legends surround his name. It is believed he could 
                    slay a dragon with a single snap of his finger or that he gained an appearence with the 12 gods and fought Krieg ending in a draw. </p><p> 
                    He never fought alone however. His greatsword, Lubius, more commonly known as The Sky Splitter was always by his side. People believe it was 
                    sentient. That a soul lived in it and it wasn't a mere tool, but a great friend of Elonias.

                <p><span class="firstword">Ivo</span>, Master of the Arcane was a powerful wizard, and a companion of Elonias. Ivo was a resident of Hiarum, an area near the Endless Forest,
                    that was considered the most diverse and peaceful place in Kramesh, before it was eradicated by Rakash, the Thunderous. Ivo and his good friend, Upuc 
                    tried to defeat Rakash by themselves, but their powers weren't enough. Hiarum was almost completely eradicated, when Ivo had the idea to flee into the Endless Forest 
                    with the ramining people. Upuc held his ground against Rakash, while Ivo created a barrier around the Last Town of Hiarum, in the endless forest, hiding and protecing it 
                    from the dangers of the world.
