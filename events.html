                First there was <b>Medeis, Nox and Ond</b>, then Medeis created the <a class=godslink href="gods.html">12 Gods</a>, 
                but  it took almost all his powers. As Ond saw this, he cut his head off, which became earth.

            <h2 id="wardragons" class="scroll">The War Against the Dragons</h2>
            <p>
                As earth was developing, people evolved quickly, ganing power in magic and technology alike. While, not much is known about the history and conflict of Arakash, 
                it is known, that by the 5th century, Kramesh has been divided into multiple kingdoms. These nations would wage war against one another for resources, 
                territory and because of cultural and religious differences. </p><p>
                This constant state of war conflicts was the perfect opportunity for Ond, to act out his plan of overtaking earth. As the people were fighting and weakening 
                each other Ond, unleashed his Army of Hell on Arv, together with 6 Arch Dragons in the year 777, whose powers were unimahinable at the time. The world was in ruins. </p><p>
                It could've been the end of humanity if it wasn't for the heroes who rose up in this time. The most famous amongst them was Elonius, an owlin, whose power 
                rivaled, even the gods'. Elonius brought the powers of the kingdoms of Kramesh together, to fight against Ond's army. The nations banded together and shared their 
                resources, to gain an advantage on the lesser dragons and the demons, while numerous powerful heroes fought the 6 Arch dragons. </p><p>
                The history of most of these warriors has not yet been uncovered<span class="andrewnote">(frankly, i haven't come up with them yet)</span>, but there are a few, 
                who are remembered to this day. </p><p>
                One of them was a giant from Rotmani, by the name of Upuk Ushac. He fought Rakash, the thunderous, far from his home land, in Litkan. Their  battle lasted years 
                but ultimately, Upuk, with his last breath, slayed the Arch Dragon. </p><p>
                Another was Lanubi, a great, torle monk, who fended off Skaad the Unseen in Morgat. It is still in question, whether Skaad had died in that battle or not. 
                His body was never found, but it is for sure that he never appeared again. After this fight, Lanubi went on, to fight alongside Elonius against the rest 
                of the Arch Dragons. </p><p>
                Another great "hero" was Sol, the Wise. Despite him, being created by Ond himself, he had not wished to cause destruction. After a long battle between 
                him and Elonius ending in a tie, he saw the beauty in Arv. He joined forces with Elonius against his brothers and sisters. </p><p>
                Soon after the war was won by Kramesh, in 845, Elonius was crowned as the first High King. The high king leads the kingdoms of Kramesh and oversees their 
                relations towards eachother.

            <h2 id="warmagic" class="scroll">The War on Magic</h2>
            <p>
                The mage's guild was a continent-wide organization that was formed after the war of the dragons in Frealof Kista. The wizards, sorcerers, druids and clerics 
                among all kingdoms came together to learn from each other, in order to create a better future after peace has been established. Magic has become widespread 
                among all the kingdoms. Its presence was becoming more and more common. Schools and organizations formed to help Kramesh and its people. The Mage's Guild 
                helped create an easier life for all. They did not discriminate based on riches, they intended to create a better life for all. They created various items 
                and a magic teleportation system among the kingdoms.</p><p>
                All changed when Avio, the First Necromancer became the arch mage of the guild. Avio's thirst for knowledge helped prosper the guild at first, but as he 
                became older his ways changed. He learned of a darker magic. The magic of death. Avio became obsessed with Nox and necromancy. He started with good intentions 
                at first, wanting necromancy to become a help for the people. Various necromancy spells helped create a better life for people and stronger defenses against 
                monsters. However, his thirst for knowledge outweighed his morals. He organized many experiments that were deemed unethical by Kramesh and its people, and he 
                was ordered to stop. Necromancy itself became an illegal practice for it had too many consequences. </p><p>
                After the controversy, the mage's guild became weaker as people started to lose trust and leave. The schools became distanced from the guild itself. 
                The people who stood by Avio helped him uncover the ways of necromancy in secret. Nox's knowledge wasn't enough anymore. Avio found ways to contact the 
                spawns of Ond. His power and knowledge grew as he became a warlock of the First Demon. </p><p>
                Elonius found out about this and wanted to stop Avio, but his power grew too far by that point. Avio killed Elonius and a war broke out(1045-1078). Demons, 
                Warlocks and Necromancers fought against the heroes and kings of Kramesh. Frealof Kista was divided as the king of it revolted against Avio. Ond Kista became 
                the home of demons in the material plane. All teleportation circles were destroyed during the war. </p><p>
                In 1078 the 6th High King, Miad and his army managed to defeat Avio and the demons. From then on, the schools and magic research were under the king's supervision. </p><p>
                Ond Kista became its own kingdom, but it is not as connected as the others. It is still considered to be somewhat evil. Because of the lack of support, 
                the living conditions are poor.

            <h2 id="pirate" class="scroll">The Great Pirate Era</h2>
            <p>
                There were always people who yearned for life on the sea. The adventures and the freedom to do whatever they want have seduced many. Some were thieves, murderers, 
                criminals, but some were kind, passionate and heroic even. Regardless of their nature, they were all deemed pirates, criminals chased by Kramesh. </p></p>
                The most legendary of them all was Hrundyr, the Free. It is said, that he and his crew, the Lousy Smiths, have travelled the entire world, finding every hidden 
                and mysterious place there is. They have gathered all that Arv has to offer. He was regarded as the most powerful and the freeset person to ever live. </p></p>
                One of the legendary, locations he has travelled to was the island of Kinosa. Kinosa was home to a unique race of people, the Kinosi, but in 1113 it mzsteriously 
                disappeared. Adventurers from all over the world, have set out to find this hidden place, but noone succeeded. That was, until Hrundyr and his crew have rediscovered 
                it in 1368. They have not revealed its location to anyone, but have claimed, that it bears great treasures, one that no mortal could ever acquire. At his 
                execution, Hrundyr told the world, that he hid everything he has ever gathered on that island. </p></p>
                This has started The Great Pirate Era as people from all over Arv set to sea in hopes of finding his treasure.
