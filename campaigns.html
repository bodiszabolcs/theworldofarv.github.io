            <h2 class="scroll" id="birdsrest">Bird's Rest</h2>
            <p>
                Bird's Rest is a finished campaign, that followed the adventures of Ebereth, Atreks, Sameia, Woods and Tymus. A group helping Egobar, a fallen noble of Arakash 
                build a town, that is devoid of bigotry. Bird's rest got its name, when the group defeated a bird-like monster as a waz to get funds. The town has become bigger 
                and bigger as people and refugees started to flow in from all around Litkan. </p><p>
                As the town became safer, the group, yearning for adventure, headed into the Endless Forest. They faced many enemies and challenges in the magical land, including 
                an encounter with the Headless Snakes, before they found what they were looking for. The Lost City of Hiarum. Hiarum was a town, lost in the unescapable hell 
                of the Endless Forest, after fleeing from Rakash. With the group finally uncovering it, and making it out of the maze, it was finally revealed again. Their lost 
                language and culture became known after hundreds of years in isolation.</p><p>
                Many adventures followed their paths after, but the recounts of them have sadly been lost.

            <h2 class="scroll" id="maidens">The Coalition of Get Maidens and Gold</h2>
            <p>
                Coalition of get maidens and gold is a campaign run by Andrew and played by Abi, Ami and Milan. The premise of the campaign is a heist gone wrong, 
                with the players starting in jail after failing to complete a heist for a gang. The Ebony Knives. Realising the group was actually sold out by the gang 
                they swore to overthrow the Ebony Knives and get their revenge. </p><p>
                The core members of the group consists of an aasimar cleric called Adriel Hallowshine, 
                a goblin rogue-sorcerer named The Pickler and a bard changeling pretending to be a human called Theodred Caberos. 
                They name themselves “The Hallowdred gang”, gathering inspiration from their names to decide the gang's title. As the campaign continues they collect 
                a variety of npcs to join their gang as members. From an orc couple to a village of sentient mushrooms, the gang befriend and help people who ask (and can pay) 
                hoping this will help lead them to the Ebony Knives they wish to destroy.  </p><p>  
                The Ebony Knives arc took around 10 real life months and 3 in game months to complete. With many subplots. The main arcs of what is considered season one is: 
                Seasons of Broken Love where The Hallowdred gang acquires a house after saving a woman from her abusive husband; The Dark Mage Saga where they searched for 
                the Ebony Knives member Irkumio and learn more about the Ebony Knives; and the Final Battle where The Hallowdred gang end up being hired by the Duke of Wistow 
                to infiltrate and kidnap Duke Llacite leading to a final battle between the two gangs where The Hallowdred left victorious.  </p><p>   
                The Hallowdred gang now head into season two where Gods seem to be the main focus of the plot. </p><p>
