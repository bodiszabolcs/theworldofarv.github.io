            <img class="pictext" src="images/medeis.jpg" alt="a cosmic god">
            <p><span class="firstword">Medeis</span> was one of the first deities in the universe. It is unknown, how he came to be, but he had great power. He created 
                star systems, suns and planets. He split the world into multiple planes of existence, all having their own function. He created 
                magic and the essence of life. Not many people worship medeis, as he is thought to be dead. It is widelz believed 
                that he was the parent of the twelve gods, who overlook the universe. He used all his powers to create his children, 
                giving each of them a unique purpose. <br> When he was at his weakest, Ond, the God of Hell, cut his head of, killing him. 
                Immediatelz after, another deity arrived. Nox, the God of Death. It is said, that he guided Medeis' soul to a peaceful place 
                outside of all the known universe. 
            </p>

        <div class="picbox">  
            <img class="pictext" src="images/ond.jpg" alt="a purple demon god">
            <p><span class="firstword">Ond</span> came to be after Medeis created the Hells. For an unknown reason, presumably out of Medeis' control, he appeared 
            in the pits of hell. His powers were almost, if not equal to that of Medeis. Medeis restricted Ond to the hells, not allowing him to meddle with other realms. Most 
            believe it was because he saw the corruption in him, and decided to stop him, before he gets out of hand, however followers of Ond are certain, that 
            was afraid of Ond's power. They say, He wanted to be the only one to have control over the Universe and he imprisoned Ond out of fear and jelousy of his superior 
            powers. They believe Medeis created his children so that they can be stronger than Ond and keep him in line.<br>
            Whatever the reason, Ond grew to despise Medeis for what he had done to him. His anger, madness and pain boiled into hatred. After Medeis created his children, his 
            power became weaker. This allowed Ond to escape from his prison and kill the one he hated most. <br>After a long fight, the 12 Gods managed to imprison Ond 
            once again, but he was not done.
            He created various demons and devils in hell, to strengthen his army against the 12. It wasn't enough however. He made 8 Arch Dragons and unleashed them onto 
            the gods' creation, Earth, which started the War Against the Dragons </p>

            <img class="pictext" src="images/nox.jpg" alt="a skeletal figure with a scythe">
            <p><span class="firstword">Nox</span> was the final Elder to appear. He came to existance, shortly after The First Death, to guide Medeis to the 
            afterlife. His purpose to look after the souls of  the dead, and to keep the balance of Life and Death. He has later created many immortal deities who 
            judge the fate of the deceased, and decide where in the afterlife thez are sent. <br>
            The God of Death has many followers, splitting into multiple religions based on the difference of their belief. The leading theory is that Nox despises 
            necromancy and the magic ofbringing the dead back to life, for it upsets the balance. These clerics and paladins believe, that Nox gave them the ability, to 
            manipulate and direct souls in order to guide them to the afterlife, and that using it to bring people back to their mortal coil is heresy. Others, 
            however believe, Nox gave them this opportunity, because he trusts them to make the right decision of who needs to live or die. </p>

            <p><span class="firstword">Aeros</span>, the Goddess of Wind is most commonly depicted as a majestic griffin, the ruler of the sky.<br> After her father's 
                death, she quickly blew his head into the orbit of the sun, and shaped it with her winds to create Earth. Followers of Aeros are divided into multiple factions. 
                Some might believe, that Aeros stands for tranguility and peace, while others believe she is a hyperactive deity, prone to making rash decisions. It is questioned 
                whether she stands for the people of Earth or she despises them. People associate natural phenomena, suc as cyclones and tornadoes with the anger of Aeros, but 
                others believe it is her divine judgement of those affected. For this, many might even dispise her.

            <p><span class="firstword">Aecor</span>, Goddess of Oceans is depicted as a whale, ruler of the seas. Most believe her to be emotional and easily upset.<br> Their 
                explanation for this belief is of course the ocean's "unpredictable" nature. Tsunamis, whirpools and storms are explained as Aecor's anger toward earth. The 
                cause of this anger differs by religion. Some think it is because the wars, the corruption of humanity and the disrespect towards nature upset her, 
                while others view her as an evil goddess who causes chaos for her own enjozment. Either way, most view her actions as unjust, for it affects those, 
                who did not add to the suffering of earth. Another belief is, that she acts for the balance of nature, not because of personal feelings.

                as it interacts with the world and eachother. Some think, however, that she has left earth to humanity, because she doesn't care for it. They believe she 
                isn't the curious innocent god depicted, but someone who just did what their family asked them to do and distances herself from the gods.

                siblings tried to stop him. His raw power was nothing against Ond's. The Demon God defeated him with ease and locked him in the sun. Ignis' power and rage 
                caused the sun to expand and heat up. It almost exploded, when his sister, Frig managed to convince him to stop. If he broke free, the force of the exlposion 
                would've wiped out everything Medeis created. It is said, that to this day he is imrisoned in the huge ball of fire.<br> It is common belief that he and Frig control
